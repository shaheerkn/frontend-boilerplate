## Documentation

For Swift we follows a structured approach to maintainability and scalability by incorporating BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology and the 7-1 architecture pattern. BEM provides a clear and organized way to create reusable and modular components, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance across the codebase. The 7-1 architecture further enhances this by organizing stylesheets into seven folders for partials, base, components, layouts, pages, themes, and vendors, facilitating better code organization and separation of concerns. This documentation outlines the guidelines and best practices for implementing BEM and the 7-1 architecture within the project, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and collaboration among team members.
